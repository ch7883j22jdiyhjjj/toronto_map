Leveraging the City of Toronto's Open Data, this map layers different aspects of the metrics about the city.

This includes fire stations, TTC stations, subway lines, work, home, UP trains, EV chargers, Costcos, solid waste transfer stations, business and neighbourhood improvement zones, parking permit zones, and ravine data.

All this is pulled dynamically at run time and overlaid on a single map.

It can be customized based on the data found in the Toronto Open Data Portal: https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/
